Salesforce Demo
Barebones demo REST client for Salesforce
Updated the source code from a recipe submitted here to use the latest version of the OAuth2 gem
http://developer.force.com/cookbook/recipe/interact-with-the-forcecom-rest-api-from-ruby

Still had to monkey patch one item since Salesforce is using an old draft of OAuth 2
