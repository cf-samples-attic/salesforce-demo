Salesforce Demo
sample.rb is a simple client for Salesforce which showcases how to use OAuth2 and REST

I updated the source code from a recipe submitted here to use the latest version of the OAuth2 gem
http://developer.force.com/cookbook/recipe/interact-with-the-forcecom-rest-api-from-ruby

I still had to monkey patch one item since Salesforce is using an old draft of OAuth 2
